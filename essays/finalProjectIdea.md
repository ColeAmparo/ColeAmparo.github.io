## Overview
*The problem*: Due to COVID many on campus exhibitions have been canceled or attendance has been artificially reduced. As a result students have had less avenues to showcase their art to the wider UH community.

*The solution*: Provide a platform for students to showcase their work as a member of the greater UH community. Users can post their works online which can then be viewed in a public gallery. Users can promote their own pieces
