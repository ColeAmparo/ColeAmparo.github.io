Semantic UI I know we had a rocky start, there was many a time that I didn't understand how to use you fully to the extent of your ability and to be honest I'm sure I have only dipped my toes into the vast amount potential you hold. I love the way that you already have built in classes that I can use and manpulate to make proffesional looking websites. I love learning about the new things I can do with you: use ui containers to make sure the margins of my wepbages are aligned, using menus and dropdowns, placing my information into columns and rows, and touching all your buttons. Semantic UI you are an *ICON* to me in many ways. This letter is a recap of the start of our relationship, the struggles, the victories, and the hope for our future together.

##Semantic UI and CSS Frameworks

At first I didn't really know what you were. I had learned the basics of you from my ex, CSS, and heard you were a CSS Framework but I didn't know what that was. After I did some research I found out that a CSS Framework is a collection of pre-existing style classes that you can use right away!
