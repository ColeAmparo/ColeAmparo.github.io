Before this class the field of software engineering was something I thought was unobtainable. I didn't understand how to work as a software engineer, previous classes have taught me programming languages, problem solving, algorithms but I was working by myself. I didn't even know what GitHub was, and now I can't live without it. The most important thing I am going to take from this class is configuration mangagement, the process of properly developing and maintaining a website. I also learned how to style a website, we started with basic css learned how to use User Interface Frameworks to easily use  nice looking premade css elements, mainly learning about Semantic UI. Finally I combined both Configuration Management and UI Frameworks in the final project where we had to make a website and deploy it using Digital Ocean. Since I was working with a team on the final project, we used Issue Driven Project Management which is a style of Agile Project Management, in order to divide the work loads. These three things were the most useful things I learned in 314.


## User Interface Frameworks

User Interface Frameworks are premade CSS classes that are used:

- To make aspects of the website look uniform and clean
- To make it easier to design UI 

We used Semantic UI as our UI Framework this semester, and even thought I was using basic CSS for less than a month at the time, one week with Semantic UI and I couldn't look back. Being able to write:

```semantic ui
<Container></Container>
```

And have Semantic UI gives you a container with custom margins and padding to put your information in. Being able to create a button and have it also be a link by adding the link as a paramenter is very useful as well. There's buttons, labels, grids, menus, dropdown menus, you have to play around with it in order to get the design you want, but it saves a lot of time. 

## Configuration Management

It might be appropriate to label this section as "My intro to GitHub" because
